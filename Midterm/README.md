As of now, this website has the following features:
* Media queries for responsive design
* A working menu dropdown
* Hover effects for text
* Hover effects for images
* Working links for scrolling between sections


Things I am still continuing to work on
* Smaller window design (it is so so so so ugly right now :( )
* Adding more media content (will also want to incorporate some of my CAD models)
* Beefing up the actual content somewhat
* Creating subpages!! Would like to add a more detailed about section, individual links about each of the prototypes, etc.. 
* Cool animations for the images and future 3d models would be nice as well - think that's a js thing.
